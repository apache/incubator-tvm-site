#### About Apache TVM
Apache TVM is an open deep learning compiler stack for CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators. It aims to close the gap between the productivity-focused deep learning frameworks,
and the performance- or efficiency-oriented hardware backends. TVM provides the following main features:

    * Compilation of deep learning models into minimum deployable modules.
    * Infrastructure to automatic generate and optimize models on more backend with better performance.

### Performance

    {:.mb-3}
    Compilation and minimal runtimes commonly unlock  ML workloads on existing hardware.

* {:.key-block}
![Run Everywhere](/assets/images/run.svg "run")
### Run Everywhere
    CPUs,  GPUs, browsers, microcontrollers, FPGAs.

    {:.mt-0.mt-lg-3}
    Automatically generate and optimize tensor operators on more backends.

* {:.key-block}
![Flexibility](/assets/images/Flexibility.svg "Flexibility")
### Flexibility
    Need support for block sparsity, quantization (1,2,4,8 bit integers, posit), random forests/classical ML, memory planning, MISRA-C compatibility, Python prototyping or all of the above?

    {:.mt-0.mt-lg-3}
    TVMâ€™s flexible design enables all of these things and more.

* {:.key-block}
![Ease of Use](/assets/images/use.svg "Ease of Use")
### Ease of Use
Compilation of deep learning models in Keras, MXNet, PyTorch, Tensorflow, CoreML, DarkNet. Start using TVM with Python today, build out production stacks using C++, Rust, or Java the next day.
